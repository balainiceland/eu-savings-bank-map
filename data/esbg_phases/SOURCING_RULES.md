# Sourcing Rules (Strict)

1. Never invent, infer, or synthesize URLs.
2. Only include a URL after directly opening it during this session.
3. If a source cannot be opened, leave the field empty.
4. Mark verification status as `pending_source_validation` unless validated.
5. Prefer primary sources:
   - official bank investor/annual-report pages
   - official press/newsroom pages
   - official developer/API portals
6. Keep a field-level citation log with access date and exact source URL.
7. Do not auto-generate fallback links like `/news`, `/investor-relations`, etc.
